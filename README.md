# SEX PREDICTION THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING UTILIZING MANDIBULAR CONDYLES, CORONOID PROCESSES, AND SIGMOID NOTCHES FEATURES

## Overview

**Characteristics of the mandible structures have been relevant in anthropological and forensic studies for sex prediction.** This project aims to evaluate the coronoid process, condyle, and sigmoid notch patterns in sex prediction through supervised machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

**Cephalometric radiographs from 410 dental records of patients were screened to investigate the morphology of the coronoid process, condyle, and sigmoid notch, as well as the Co-Gn distance.**

## Machine Learning Algorithms

**The following machine learning algorithms were utilized to build predictive models:**

- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLP)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation

**A 5-fold cross-validation approach was adopted to validate each model. Metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 Score were calculated for each model. ROC curves were also constructed to visualize the performance of the models.**
